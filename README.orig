A collection of C extension Vim syntax files for
- xlib
- glib
- gobject
- gdk
- gdk-pixbuf
- gtk+
- atk
- pango
- cairo
- gimp
- libglade
- libgnome
- libgnomecanvas

- gtkglext
- vte
- linc
- gconf
- ORBit

They are extensions of the standard C syntax highlighting to additional
types, functions, macros, and constants, they are not meant to replace it.
So you should include them in your ~/.vim/after/syntax/c.vim file (see
:h runtimepath for more).  An example is provided as c.vim.example.

The xlib.vim file comes from older Gtk+ syntax higlighting files by Hwanjin
Choe (see http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=570).

The others were generated with vim-syn-gen.py script by David Neèas (Yeti)
(see http://trific.ath.cx/resources/vim/scripts/#vim-syn-gen).

They all allow special handling of deprecated symbols.  By default,
deprecated symbols are not highlighted.  By setting (e.g.)

  :let glib_enable_deprecated = 1

in your vimrc you can enable highlighting of deprecated declarations in glib
as normal symbols.  By setting

  :let glib_deprecated_errors = 1

you can enable highlighting deprecated glib symbols as Error.

The exact library version from which each syntax file was generated is
included in its metadata.
